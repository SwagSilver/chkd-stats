If you are making your own bot,
you must replace all of the
IDs in $onlyforIDs and $authorID
with YOUR OWN ID or the IDs
of the developers of your bot,
if you do not do this it will
result in you and the other devs
of your bot not being able to use
admin commands.

If you are adding other items/varieties
of children, you must replace some 
variables with your own variables or
else it wont work.
